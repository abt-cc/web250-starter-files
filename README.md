# WEB 250 Starter Files

These files are for students in WEB 250 - Database-driven Websites at A-B Tech CC. 

The files are based on the [PHP: OOP Databases series from LinkedIn/Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/php-object-oriented-programming-with-databases/welcome?u=57691225). I have modified the files from the tutorial by creating a database on Western NC Birds and prepared the files to work with PDO instead of MySQLi. 

## TODO

Update CSS. This is the CSS that came with the tutorial.
